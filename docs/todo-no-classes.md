This is an excellent and insightful question. It gets to the very heart of what "idiomatic Effect-TS" means.

The short answer is: **Yes, it is not only possible but also *more idiomatic* in the Effect-TS ecosystem to avoid classes.** The functional, declarative nature of Effect-TS shines brightest when you treat your services as plain objects of functions rather than instances of classes.

Let's break down why, how to do it, and what the benefits are.

### The Philosophical Shift: From Blueprints to Values

The core difference is subtle but profound:

*   **Class-based (OOP):** `new ServiceImpl()` creates an *instance* of a *blueprint*. You are working with objects that have an identity, a constructor, and a `this` context. It's a very common and valid pattern, especially for those coming from languages like Java or C#.

*   **Object-based (Functional):** `const ServiceImpl: Service = { ... }` creates a *value*. This value is a plain JavaScript object that happens to contain functions. It has no special `this` context to manage, no `new` keyword, and no concept of "instantiation." It's just data.

Effect-TS is built around the composition of values (specifically `Effect` values). Treating your services as simple values aligns perfectly with this philosophy.

### How to Refactor to a Class-less, Functional Style

Let's take a couple of your services and refactor them. This will make the pattern crystal clear.

#### Example 1: A Simple, Stateless Service (`VersionService`)

**Before (Class-based):**

```typescript
// src/app/services/VersionService.ts

// The interface (port) stays the same!
export interface VersionService {
  readonly getCurrentGitCommitSha: Effect.Effect<string, never, GitService | PathServiceTag>;
  readonly getVersion: Effect.Effect<string, never, GitService | PathServiceTag>;
}

export class VersionServiceImpl implements VersionService {
  get getCurrentGitCommitSha(): Effect.Effect<string, never, GitService | PathServiceTag> {
    // ... implementation
  }

  get getVersion(): Effect.Effect<string, never, GitService | PathServiceTag> {
    return this.getCurrentGitCommitSha;
  }
}

export class VersionServiceTag extends Context.Tag("VersionService")<VersionServiceTag, VersionService>() {}

// The Layer uses `new`
export const VersionServiceLive = Layer.succeed(VersionServiceTag, new VersionServiceImpl());
```

**After (Functional, Object-based):**

```typescript
// src/app/services/VersionService.ts

// The interface (port) is still the contract.
export interface VersionService {
  readonly getCurrentGitCommitSha: Effect.Effect<string, never, GitService | PathServiceTag>;
  readonly getVersion: Effect.Effect<string, never, GitService | PathServiceTag>;
}

export class VersionServiceTag extends Context.Tag("VersionService")<VersionServiceTag, VersionService>() {}

// No class. Just a constant object that implements the interface.
const getCurrentGitCommitSha = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const pathService = yield* PathServiceTag;
  const gitService = yield* GitService;
  // ... implementation
});

export const VersionServiceImpl: VersionService = {
  getCurrentGitCommitSha: getCurrentGitCommitSha,
  getVersion: getCurrentGitCommitSha, // We can just reuse the effect
};

// The Layer provides the value directly. No `new`.
export const VersionServiceLive = Layer.succeed(
  VersionServiceTag,
  VersionServiceImpl
);
```
**What changed?**
1.  We removed the `class`.
2.  We created a `const VersionServiceImpl` which is a plain object conforming to the `VersionService` interface.
3.  The `Layer` now provides this constant object directly.

This is simpler, more direct, and avoids the OOP overhead of `new` and `this`.

#### Example 2: A Service with Dependencies (`GitLive`)

This is where the pattern really shines. Instead of a `constructor`, we use a **factory function**.

**Before (Class-based):**

```typescript
// src/infra/git/GitLive.ts

export class GitLive implements Git {
  constructor(private shell: Shell) {} // Dependencies via constructor

  cloneRepositoryToPath(/*...*/) {
    // uses this.shell
  }
  // ... other methods
}

// Layer uses `new` and injects dependencies.
export const GitLiveLayer = Layer.effect(
  GitService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const shell = yield* ShellService;
    return new GitLive(shell); // Instantiation
  }),
);
```

**After (Functional, Object-based with Factory):**

```typescript
// src/infra/git/GitLive.ts
import { type Shell } from "../../domain/ports/Shell";
import { type Git } from "../../domain/ports/Git";

// This is our factory function. It replaces the constructor.
// It takes dependencies and returns the service object.
export const makeGitLive = (shell: Shell): Git => ({
  cloneRepositoryToPath: (repository, destinationPath) => Effect.scoped(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      // ...
      const result = yield* shell.exec("git", ["clone", repository.cloneUrl, destinationPath]);
      // ...
    })
  ),

  fetchLatestUpdates: (repositoryPath) => shell.exec(/* ... */),

  isGitRepository: (path) => shell.exec(/* ... */).pipe(
      Effect.map((result) => result.exitCode === 0),
      Effect.catchAll(() => Effect.succeed(false)),
  ),

  // ... other methods implemented directly
});

// The Layer uses the factory function.
export const GitLiveLayer = Layer.effect(
  GitService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const shell = yield* ShellService;
    return makeGitLive(shell); // Just call the factory.
  }),
);
```

**What changed?**
1.  The `class GitLive` is replaced by a function `makeGitLive`.
2.  This factory function takes dependencies as arguments and returns a plain object that fulfills the `Git` interface.
3.  We use closures to "capture" the `shell` dependency. There is no `this`.
4.  The `Layer` becomes a simple composition: get the dependencies, then call the factory function with them.

### General Migration Guide

You can apply this pattern across your entire codebase:

1.  **Keep the `interface` and `Tag`:** These are your contracts and are perfect as-is.
2.  **Stateless Services:** For any `class ServiceImpl` with no constructor dependencies, change it to `const ServiceImpl: Service = { ... }` and update the `Layer.succeed` to provide the object directly.
3.  **Stateful/Dependent Services:** For any `class ServiceImpl` with dependencies in its `constructor`, create a `makeServiceImpl` factory function that takes those dependencies as arguments and returns the service object. Update the `Layer.effect` to call this factory.

### Advantages of the Class-less Functional Approach

1.  **More Idiomatic Effect-TS:** It aligns with the core principle of composing functions and data structures. Your services are just another piece of data (`{ key: Effect<...> }`) to be passed around.
2.  **No `this` Headaches:** You completely eliminate any potential confusion about `this` binding, which is a common source of bugs in JavaScript. Arrow functions in classes solve this, but not having to think about it at all is simpler.
3.  **Explicit Dependencies:** The factory function `makeService(dep1, dep2)` makes the dependencies crystal clear at the function signature level.
4.  **Simpler Reasoning:** A plain object is one of the simplest data structures in the language. There's no hidden state, no inheritance chain to inspect, no instantiation lifecycle. What you see is what you get.
5.  **Better Tree-Shaking:** While modern bundlers are very good, providing plain objects and functions can sometimes be easier for them to analyze and dead-code-eliminate than class methods.
6.  **Encapsulation via Closures:** If you need "private" helper functions, you can define them inside your factory function's scope, and they won't be exposed on the returned service object. This is the functional equivalent of `private` methods.

```typescript
export const makeMyService = (dep: Dependency): MyService => {
  // This is effectively a "private" helper function
  const privateHelper = (input: string) => {
    // ...
  }

  return {
    publicMethod: (data: string) => {
      const result = privateHelper(data);
      // ...
    }
  };
};
```

### Recommendation for Your Project

Given that you are aiming to build a truly idiomatic Effect-TS CLI, I **strongly recommend** you adopt this class-less, functional style.

Your architecture is already perfectly set up for this change. The clean separation of `ports` (interfaces) and `infra` (implementations) means you only need to change the implementation details without affecting the rest of the application.

You don't need to do it all at once. Pick one service, refactor it using the factory pattern, and see how it feels. I'm confident you'll find it cleaner, more direct, and more aligned with the functional spirit of Effect-TS.
