Of course. This is an excellent foundation for a modern CLI tool. The use of a layered architecture with Effect-TS is very well done. You've clearly put a lot of thought into separating concerns, which is the hardest part.

Here is a comprehensive review of your codebase, focusing on adherence to your architecture, idiomatic Effect-TS usage, and general improvements.

### Overall Architecture & Design: A+

You have successfully implemented a clean, layered (or "Onion"/"Hexagonal") architecture. This is a major achievement and sets you up for a scalable and maintainable codebase.

*   **Domain-Driven:** The `domain` layer is pure and free of infrastructure concerns. The separation of `ports` (interfaces) from `infra` (implementations) is textbook-perfect.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The use of Effect `Layer`s in `src/wiring.ts` as the "Composition Root" is fantastic. This is the idiomatic way to handle dependencies in Effect, and you've nailed it.
*   **Error Handling:** Using `Data.TaggedError` for your error types (`DevError`) is the correct and most powerful way to handle errors in Effect.
*   **Resource Management:** Your `RunStoreLiveLayer` using `Layer.scoped` with `Effect.acquireRelease` for the database connection is a perfect example of safe, managed resource handling.

### Key Strengths to Acknowledge

1.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The directory structure (`app`, `domain`, `infra`) is not just for show; the code within correctly respects these boundaries (with one or two minor exceptions we'll discuss).
2.  **Robust Dependency Management:** `src/wiring.ts` is a model composition root. It's easy to see how services are constructed and what their dependencies are.
3.  **Graceful Shutdown & Interruption:** The use of `BunRuntime.runMain`, `addFinalizer`, and `onInterrupt` in `src/index.ts` shows a deep understanding of building resilient applications that clean up after themselves.
4.  **Configuration Handling:** The `ConfigLoader` service with Zod validation, migrations, and remote refresh capabilities is very robust.
5.  **Concurrency:** You're correctly using `Effect.all` with concurrency limits in commands like `status` and `upgrade` for better performance.

### Areas for Improvement & Idiomatic Refinements

While the foundation is solid, we can make it even more idiomatic and robust. Here are my main suggestions, from most impactful to least.

#### 1. Major Improvement: Fixing the `cd` Shell Integration

This is the most significant architectural improvement you can make.

**The Problem:** The current `dev cd` command relies on the `zshrc.sh` script capturing the *entire stdout* of the `bun` process and then using `grep` to find a `CD:` line.

```sh
# hack/zshrc.sh
result=$(bun "$HOME"/.dev/src/index.ts "$@")
# ...
cd_line=$(echo "$result" | grep "^CD:" || true)
```

This has a major drawback: **it buffers all output**. You cannot have any interactive output (like spinners from `fzf`, progress bars, or even simple logs) before the `CD:` line is printed. Everything is held back until the command finishes.

**The Solution: Use a Temporary State File**

A more robust and flexible pattern is to have the CLI write the target directory to a well-known temporary file. The shell function then checks for this file's existence, reads it, `cd`s, and deletes it.

**Step 1: Modify `ShellIntegrationService`**
Instead of `console.log`, it should write to a file.

```typescript
// src/app/services/ShellIntegrationService.ts
import { PathServiceTag } from "../../domain/services/PathService";
import { FileSystemService } from "../../domain/ports/FileSystem";

export class ShellIntegrationServiceImpl implements ShellIntegrationService {
  private getCdFilePath = (pathService: PathService) =>
    path.join(pathService.dataDir, "cd_target");

  // This is the new, recommended way
  changeDirectoryViaFile(targetPath: string) {
    return Effect.gen(function*() {
      const pathService = yield* PathServiceTag;
      const fs = yield* FileSystemService;
      const cdFile = this.getCdFilePath(pathService);

      // Ensure the target directory exists first
      const exists = yield* fs.exists(targetPath);
      if (!exists) {
        return yield* Effect.fail(new ConfigError({ reason: `Directory does not exist: ${targetPath}` }));
      }

      yield* fs.writeFile(cdFile, targetPath);
    }.bind(this));
  }

  // ... keep handleCdToPathLegacy for now if you want
}
```

**Step 2: Update `cd` Command**
Use the new service method.

```typescript
// src/app/commands/cd.ts

// in handleDirectCd and handleInteractiveCd...
if (targetPath) {
    const shellIntegration = yield* ShellIntegrationServiceTag;
    // Use the new method
    yield* shellIntegration.changeDirectoryViaFile(absolutePath);
}
```

**Step 3: Update `hack/zshrc.sh`**
The shell function becomes simpler and more reliable.

```sh
# hack/zshrc.sh

function dev() {
  local cd_target_file="$HOME/.local/share/dev/cd_target"

  # Ensure the file doesn't exist before running
  rm -f "$cd_target_file"

  # Run the command, allowing its output to go directly to the terminal
  bun "$HOME"/.dev/src/index.ts "$@"
  local exit_code=$?

  # After the command finishes, check if the target file was created
  if [[ -f "$cd_target_file" ]]; then
    local dir_to_cd
    dir_to_cd=$(<"$cd_target_file")
    rm -f "$cd_target_file"

    if [[ -n "$dir_to_cd" ]]; then
      cd "$dir_to_cd"
    fi
  fi

  return $exit_code
}
```

This change decouples the shell integration from stdout, allowing for fully interactive commands that can also change the shell's directory.

#### 2. Abstracting Infrastructure from Application Logic

**The Problem:** The `cd` command directly uses `Bun.spawn(["fzf"], ...)` inside `handleInteractiveCd`. This is an infrastructure detail (running an external process) living inside an application command, which violates your own architectural rules.

**The Solution: Create a Port and Adapter for Interactive Selection**

**Step 1: Define a Port**
Create a new port for this capability in the domain.

```typescript
// src/domain/ports/InteractiveSelector.ts
import { Context, type Effect } from "effect";
import { type UnknownError } from "../errors";

export interface InteractiveSelector {
  /**
   * Presents a list of choices to the user and returns the selected one.
   * Returns null if the user cancels.
   */
  select(choices: string[]): Effect.Effect<string | null, UnknownError>;
}

export class InteractiveSelectorService extends Context.Tag("InteractiveSelectorService")<
  InteractiveSelectorService,
  InteractiveSelector
>() {}
```

**Step 2: Create an FZF Implementation (Adapter)**
This is your infrastructure layer.

```typescript
// src/infra/selectors/FzfLive.ts
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
import { InteractiveSelector, InteractiveSelectorService } from "../../domain/ports/InteractiveSelector";
import { ShellService } from "../../domain/ports/Shell";
import { unknownError } from "../../domain/errors";

export class FzfLive implements InteractiveSelector {
  constructor(private shell: Shell) {}

  select(choices: string[]): Effect.Effect<string | null, UnknownError> {
    const input = choices.join("\n");

    // Using a more declarative shell service instead of Bun.spawn directly
    return Effect.tryPromise({
      try: async () => {
        const proc = Bun.spawn(["fzf"], {
          stdin: "pipe",
          stdout: "pipe",
          stderr: "inherit", // Show fzf UI errors to the user
        });

        proc.stdin.write(input);
        proc.stdin.end();

        const exitCode = await proc.exited;
        if (exitCode === 0) {
          return new Response(proc.stdout).text().then(t => t.trim());
        }
        // fzf returns 130 on ESC/Ctrl-C, which is a cancellation, not an error.
        if (exitCode === 1 || exitCode > 128) {
          return null;
        }
        throw new Error(`fzf exited with code ${exitCode}`);
      },
      catch: (e) => unknownError(`fzf selection failed: ${e}`),
    });
  }
}

export const FzfLiveLayer = Layer.effect(
  InteractiveSelectorService,
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    const shell = yield* ShellService;
    return new FzfLive(shell);
  })
);
```

**Step 3: Wire it Up**
Add `FzfLiveLayer` to your `InfraLiveLayer` in `src/wiring.ts`.

**Step 4: Use the Service in `cd.ts`**
The command becomes much cleaner and respects the architecture.

```typescript
// src/app/commands/cd.ts
import { InteractiveSelectorService } from '../../domain/ports/InteractiveSelector';

function handleInteractiveCd(): Effect.Effect<void, DevError, any> {
  return Effect.gen(function* () {
    const directoryService = yield* DirectoryServiceTag;
    const selector = yield* InteractiveSelectorService;

    const directories = yield* directoryService.findDirs();
    if (directories.length === 0) { /* ... */ }

    const selectedPath = yield* selector.select(directories);

    if (selectedPath) {
      // ... now use shell integration service
    }
  });
}
```

#### 3. Refine Configuration Handling

**The Problem:** Many services like `RepositoryService.expandToFullGitUrl` take the entire `Config` object as a parameter. This creates a tight coupling; the service knows more than it needs to.

**The Solution: Inject Configuration via a Service Tag**

This makes the configuration available throughout the Effect context without needing to pass it down through function arguments.

**Step 1: Create a Tag for the Config**

```typescript
// src/config/schema.ts
import { Context } from "effect";
import { type Config } from "../domain/models";

// ... existing code

export class ConfigTag extends Context.Tag("Config")<ConfigTag, Config>() {}
```

**Step 2: Provide the Config in the Main Layer**
Modify `ConfigLoaderLiveLayer` to not just provide the loader, but also load the config and provide it to the context.

```typescript
// src/config/loader.ts
import { ConfigTag } from "./schema";

// ...

export const ConfigLayer = Layer.effect(
  ConfigTag,
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    const configLoader = yield* ConfigLoaderService;
    // Load (and refresh if needed) the config once at startup.
    return yield* configLoader.refresh();
  })
);

export const AppLayers = Layer.mergeAll(
  ConfigLoaderLiveLayer(...), // The loader service
  ConfigLayer, // The actual loaded config object
  // ... other layers
);
```
Then, in your main `wiring.ts`, you would compose this new `AppLayers`.

**Step 3: Access the Config Where Needed**
Now, any service that needs the config can simply request it from the context.

```typescript
// src/domain/services/RepositoryService.ts
import { ConfigTag } from "../../config/schema";

export class RepositoryServiceImpl implements RepositoryService {
  expandToFullGitUrl(repoInput: string, forceProvider?: "github" | "gitlab") {
    return Effect.gen(function*() {
      const config = yield* ConfigTag; // <-- Access config from context

      // ... logic that uses config.defaultOrg, etc.
    });
  }
  // ...
}
```
This decouples your services from the method signatures of their callers and makes them depend only on the `ConfigTag`.

#### 4. Improve User-Facing Error Reporting

**The Problem:** In `cli/parser.ts`, the final `catchAll` block stringifies the error, which is not user-friendly.

```typescript
// cli/parser.ts
Effect.logError(`❌ ${error._tag}: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
```

**The Solution: Create a User-Friendly Error Formatter**

```typescript
// src/cli/errors.ts (a new file for presentation-layer logic)
import { type DevError } from "../domain/errors";

export function formatErrorForUser(error: DevError): string {
    let message = `Error: [${error._tag}] `;
    switch (error._tag) {
        case "ConfigError":
        case "GitError":
        case "NetworkError":
        case "AuthError":
        case "FileSystemError":
        case "UserInputError":
        case "CLIError":
            message += error.reason;
            if (error._tag === "FileSystemError" && error.path) {
                message += `\nPath: ${error.path}`;
            }
            break;
        case "ExternalToolError":
            message += `${error.message}`;
            if (error.tool) message += ` (Tool: ${error.tool})`;
            if (error.stderr) message += `\nDetails: ${error.stderr}`;
            break;
        case "UnknownError":
            message += `An unexpected error occurred.`;
            // In debug mode, you might want to log the full reason
            console.error(error.reason);
            break;
    }
    return message;
}
```

Then use this in your parser:

```typescript
// src/cli/parser.ts
import { formatErrorForUser } from "./errors"; // or wherever you place it

// ... in the final catchAll
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const logger = yield* LoggerService; // Get the logger
  const userMessage = formatErrorForUser(error);
  yield* logger.error(userMessage); // Use your styled logger
  yield* Effect.sync(() => {
    process.exitCode = exitCode(error);
  });
});
```

### Code-Level Nitpicks & Suggestions

*   In `src/app/commands/clone.ts`, `const baseDir = fileSystem.resolvePath("~/src");` is hardcoded. This should come from the loaded configuration via the `ConfigTag` we discussed.
*   In `src/domain/matching.ts`, the fuzzy matching algorithm is quite complex. This is fine, but consider adding comments explaining the DP state machine or linking to the fzf algorithm's source if that's what it's based on. It's not immediately obvious how it works.
*   In `auth.ts`, `promptPasswordEffect` notes that it doesn't hide input. For a real CLI, you'd want to use a library or platform-specific feature for this. For now, the comment is sufficient.
*   The `dev` function in `zshrc.sh` re-evaluates the brew and mise shellenvs every time it's run. This is usually very fast, but for maximum performance, these `eval` lines could be moved to the user's main `.zshrc` file so they only run once at shell startup. This is a minor trade-off.

### Summary

You have built a very impressive and well-architected CLI. Your grasp of Effect-TS principles is strong. By focusing on the improvements below, you can elevate it from a great tool to a truly robust, idiomatic, and production-grade application:

1.  **Fix the `cd` shell integration** by using a temporary file instead of stdout piping. This is the most critical change for a good user experience.
2.  **Abstract `fzf`** into its own `InteractiveSelector` service to fully adhere to your architectural layers.
3.  **Refactor configuration access** to use a `ConfigTag` for better decoupling.
4.  **Improve user-facing error messages** for a more polished feel.

This is a fantastic project. Keep up the great work
